# Tasks to do List
This Project is a web-based To-Do List app built with Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and Jinja2 that lets users add tasks with priorities, mark them completed, and delete them. Pending and completed tasks are shown separately in block-style cards, stored in tasks.txt, with default tasks like Reading Books, Cooking, and Music.
